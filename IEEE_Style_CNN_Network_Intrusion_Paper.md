# A CNN-Based Network Intrusion Detection System: An IEEE Style Paper for 2025

## Abstract
Network intrusion detection is a critical component of cybersecurity, aiming to identify malicious activities within network traffic. This paper presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach for network intrusion detection using a comprehensive dataset of network attacks. The proposed system incorporates advanced data preprocessing, class imbalance handling, and a robust CNN architecture to achieve high detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in identifying various types of network intrusions with strong performance metrics.

## 1. Introduction
With the increasing complexity and volume of network traffic, traditional intrusion detection systems face challenges in accurately detecting sophisticated attacks. Deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown promise in automatically extracting features and improving detection rates. This paper proposes a CNN-based network intrusion detection system designed to address data quality issues and class imbalance, providing a reliable solution for real-time network security.

## 2. Related Work
Previous research has explored machine learning and deep learning methods for intrusion detection. Traditional approaches rely on handcrafted features and shallow classifiers, which may not generalize well. CNNs have been applied to network traffic data to capture spatial and temporal patterns, outperforming classical methods. However, challenges remain in handling noisy data and imbalanced classes, which this work aims to address.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Dataset Description and Preprocessing
The system utilizes a network attacks dataset containing various types of intrusions and normal traffic. Data cleaning involves removing missing and infinite values, eliminating duplicates, and standardizing features using a StandardScaler. Categorical labels are encoded, and data is reshaped to fit the CNN input format (samples, timesteps, channels).

### 3.2 CNN Architecture
The CNN model consists of three convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes (64, 128, 256), each followed by batch normalization and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. Max pooling layers reduce dimensionality, and fully connected dense layers perform classification. The output layer uses a softmax activation function for multi-class classification.

### 3.3 Training Procedure
The model is trained using weighted loss functions to address class imbalance. Early stopping and model checkpointing are employed to optimize training and prevent overfitting. The training process includes visualization of loss and accuracy curves to monitor performance.

## 4. Experimental Results

### 4.1 Performance Metrics
The model achieves high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score across multiple classes. A confusion matrix provides detailed insights into classification performance, highlighting the model's ability to distinguish between different attack types and normal traffic.

### 4.2 Visualizations
Training history plots illustrate the convergence of the model, while the confusion matrix visualization confirms robust classification results.

## 5. Discussion
The proposed CNN-based intrusion detection system effectively handles noisy and imbalanced data, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Limitations include dependency on dataset quality and computational resources for training. Future work will explore real-time deployment and integration with network monitoring tools.

## 6. Conclusion
This paper presents a comprehensive CNN-based approach for network intrusion detection, combining advanced preprocessing, a well-designed CNN architecture, and effective training strategies. The system achieves strong detection performance, contributing to enhanced network security.
