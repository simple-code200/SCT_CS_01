# TODO: Real-Time Network Monitoring Setup

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update requirements.txt to include scapy and streamlit
- [x] Install dependencies
- [x] Check for CNN model files (cnn_network_intrusion_final.h5, scaler_cnn_final.pkl, label_encoder_cnn_final.pkl)
- [ ] If model files are missing, train the CNN model using train_network_intrusion_cnn.py (in progress)
- [ ] Run the Streamlit app (app.py) with admin privileges for live monitoring
- [ ] Provide usage instructions for real-time monitoring
- [ ] Optionally, make improvements to app.py for better robustness
